	The classes in this module will need
	to be placed into media queries for responsiveness.
	The dimensions need to be worked out so that the
	table container fits on the screen as a square 
	for a variety of screen sizes. The table-center
	should contain the deck item itself, and 
	the math needs to be worked out so that 
	the spacing relative to the top three class/id
	rules here stay in sync regardless of the screen
	size.
